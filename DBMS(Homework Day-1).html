        <h3> Database Management System Theory</h3>
        <p> Data consists of raw, unprocessed facts and figures without context. Information is data that has been processed, organized, or structured to provide meaning and context. While data is the raw input, information is the meaningful output derived from analyzing and interpreting that data.</p>
        <h3> Meta Data: </h3> 
        <p> Meta Data is defined as data about data. It is helpful as it helps to keep record of the large number of data that might be in the database</p>
        <h3> Data dictionary: </h3> 
        <p> Data dictionary is aso similar to meta data, differ in that it is a centralied repository where meta data is stored.</p>
        <h3> Table: </h3> 
        <p>Table is a part of DBMS by which we can organize the data. The rows usually represent a unique piece of data whereas the columns define an attritube of that data.</p>
        <h3> Tuple:</h3>
        <p> A single entry in a table is referred to as a tuple, one single of the table is a tuple.</p>
        <h3> Field:</h3> 
        <p> A field is a single column in the row. It defines the table's structure by specifying the type of data that can be stored.</p>
        <h3>Domain:</h3> 
        <p>The range or specific type of data that can be entered into a field is a domain. For 'Age' the maximum value might be kept to 150, where 0 to 150 would be it's domain.</p>
        <h3>Constrains:</h3> 
        <p>It is a rule that limits the type of data that is permissible in a field. In the 'Age' field, we can make it so that only numeral data types are allowed.</p>
        <h3>Key:</h3> 
        <p>They're used to idenfity rows or tuples in a table uniquely.</p>
